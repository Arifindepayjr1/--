        <h1> The Evolution of the Bicycle </h1>
        <p>  In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help 
             him to get around the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels 
             , the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled 
             . The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling 
             yourself and the device forward in a sort of giding walk. 
        </p>
        <p class = "relative">
            The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. 
            This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being pratical for transportation in 
            any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 
            1865, when pedals were applied directly to the front wheel.
            This machine was known as the velocipede ( meaning "fast foot") as well as 
            the "bone shaker, " since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day 
            made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and 
            indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.
