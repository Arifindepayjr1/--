                <h2> The First Bicycle </h2>
                <p>  In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would 
                     help him get around help him get around the royal gardens faster:
                     two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame 
                     upon which straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your 
                     feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward 
                     in a sort of gliding walk. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     The machine became known as the Draisienne ( or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely 
                     of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being pratical for tranportation 
                     in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or graden.
                </p>
                <h2> Further Innovations </h2>
                <p>  The next appearence of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were 
                     applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede ( meaning "fast foot") as 
                     well as the "bone shaker," since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made 
                     for an extremely uncomfortable ride they also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, 
                     could be found in large cities.    
                </p>
                <p>
                     In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. ( Pior to this metallurgy was not advanced enough to provide metal which 
                     was strong enough to make small, light parts out of.) The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel with no freewheeling 
                     mechanism. Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.
