        <h1> The Evolution of the Bicycle </h1>
        <p>  In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that 
             would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two same-size 
             in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which 
             you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground 
             , thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
        </p>
        <p>  The machine became known as the Draisienne ( or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This 
             enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being pratical for transportation in any other place 
             then a well maintained pathway such as in a park garden. 
        </p>
        <p>  The next appearence of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when 
             pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the 
             velocipede ( meaning "fast foot") as well as the "boen shaker," since its wooden structure 
             combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They 
             also became fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in a large 
             cities.
        </p>
        <p>  In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. ( Prior to this metallurgy was not advance enough to provide
            metal which was strong enough to make small, light parts out of.) The pedals were attached directly to the front 
            wheel with no freewheeling mechanism. Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large 
            front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.
