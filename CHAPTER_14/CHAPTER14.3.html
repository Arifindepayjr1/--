        <h1> Quotes from Edgar Allan Poe </h1>
        <ul> 
            <li> I have great faith; self-confidence 
                 my friends call it.
            </li>
            <li> All that we see or seem is but a dream 
                 within a dream.
            </li>
            <li> I would define, in brief the poetry of 
                 words as the rhythmical creation of Beauty.
            </li>
        </ul>
