        <h1> Briard </h1>
        <p> by Ivy Duckett </p>
        <p> The <a href> briard, </a> or berger de brie, is 
        a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep. </p>
        <h1> Breed History </h1>
        <p> The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries 
            to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and 
            to search for wounded soldiers becuase of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the Frist 
            Word War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering 
            Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all ownd briards.
