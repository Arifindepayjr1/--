        <h1> From Garden to Plate </h1>
        <p> A <em> potager </em> is a French term for an 
            ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. Often 
            flowers ( edible and non-edible ) and herbs are 
            planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden 
            's beauty. The goal is to make the function of
            providing aesthetically pleasing 
        </p>
        <h2> What is Plant </h2>
        <p> Plants are chosen as much for their functionality 
            as for their color and form. Many are trained to grow 
            upward. A well-designed potager can provide food, cut
            flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintence.
            Potagers can disguise their function of providing for a home 
            in a wide array of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage
            garden to the formality of a knot garden.
