        <h1> Breed History </h1>
        <p>  The briard, which is believed to have originated in 
             France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect
             sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, 
             messengers and search for wounded soldiers becuase of its
             fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in First World War almost
             to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is 
             slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all 
             ownled briards.
