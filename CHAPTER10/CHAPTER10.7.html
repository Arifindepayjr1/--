        <h1> The Cottage Garden </h1>
        <p> The cottage garden is a distinct style of garden
            that uses an informal design, dense planting
            , and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. </p>
        <p> The Cottage Garden originated in <a href> England </a>
            and its history can be traced back for centuuries, although
            they were re-invented in 1870's England, When stylized
            versions were form as a reaction to the more structured
            and rigorously maintained <a href> English estates gardens </a>
        </p>
        <p> The earliest cottage gardens were moer pratical than their modern
            descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs,
            along with some fruit trees.
