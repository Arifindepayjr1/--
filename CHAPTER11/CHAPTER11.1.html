        <h2> The Composition of Seawater </h2>
        <p> Almost anything can be found in seawater 
            . This includes dissolved materials from 
            Earth's crust as well as materials released 
            from organisms. The most important components
            of seawater that influence life froms are 
            salinity, temperature, dissolved gases 
            (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients 
            and pH. These elements vary in their Composition
            as well as their influence on marine life.
