        <h1> The Evolution of the Bicycle </h1>
        <p> In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that 
            would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two same-
            size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame 
            upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet 
            against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort 
            of gliding walk.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The machine became known as the Draisienne ( or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely 
            of wood. This enjoyed a short live popularity as a fad, not being pratical for transportation 
            in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.

            The next appearence of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were 
            applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede ( meaning "fast foot") as well

            uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, 
            as the "bone shaker," since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an 
            could be found in large cities.
