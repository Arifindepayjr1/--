            <h1> Briards </h1>
            <h2> by Ivy Duckett </h2>
            <p> The <a href=""> briard </a> or berger de brie, is a larger
                breed of dog tranditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep
            </p>
            <h1> Breed History </h1>
            <p> The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred
                for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French
                Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers becuase of its
                fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World war almost to the point
                of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering
                . Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
