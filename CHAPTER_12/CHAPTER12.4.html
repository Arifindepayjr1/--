        <h1> Briards </h1>
        <h2> by Ivy Duckett </h2>
        <p> The <a href=""> briard </a> or berger de brie, is a larger
            breed of dog tranditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep
        </p>
        <h1> Breed History </h1>
        <p> The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred
            for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French
            Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers becuase of its
            fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World war almost to the point
            of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering
            . Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
