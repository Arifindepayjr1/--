        <p> When we use the abbrevation or acronym we could use it in the abbrevation
            element and the attribute within the opening tag of the abbrevation tag element
            will specify the full term of that acronym or abbrevation</p>
        </p>

            In HTML4 we use the have a seperate acronym element for thew acronym with the title 
            attribute to specify the full term of that acronym. right now in HTML5 the abbrivate element use 
            in both abbrivation and acronym.
