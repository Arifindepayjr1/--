        <p> If you want to open a link on a new window we need to use the 
            target attribute with a opening tag and the value of the target attribute
            should be blank.
        </p>
        <p> The common reason that the webpage author want to 
            open link in the new window if it's the point of the 
            another website. in such case we hope that the users 
            will return back to the browser containing site
            after finishing looking for ther other site.
        </p>
        <p>
            we should generally avoid opening in other window
            but if we do it's a good practice to inform to the users
            that we are opening the link on the new window before the users
            open it.
