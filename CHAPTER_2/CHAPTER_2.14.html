        <p>A <cite>Brief History of time</cite> by Stephen Hawking has sold over ten 
        million copies worldside. </p>
        <p> when we do reference from a piece of work such as a book research paper
            film ... we use the cite element to indicate where the citation is from
        </p>
        <p> HTML5 dont allow you to use the cite element with a person name but HTML4 does so people usually continue using it
        </p>
        <p> browser display the content between these element in italics </p>
