                <h2> The First Bicycle </h1>
                <p>  In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a 
                     walking machine that would help him get 
                     around the royal gardens faster: two same-size
                     in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in 
                     a frame upon which you straddle. The device was propelled 
                     by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the 
                     device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
                </p>
                <p>
                     The machine became knownas the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was
                     made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not 
                     being pratical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway 
                     such as in a park or garden. 
                </p>

                <h2> Further Innovations </h1>
                <p>  The next appearence of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 
                     1865, when pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This 
                     machine was known as the velocipede ( meaning "fast foot") as well as 
                     the "boner shaker," since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads 
                     of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding 
                     academies, similar to rollar rink, could be found in large cities.
                </p>
                <p>
                     In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. ( Pior to this, metallurgy was 
                     not advance enough to make smalllight parts out of.) The pedals were attached 
                     directly to the front wheel with no freewheeling mechanism. Solid rubber 
                     tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride 
                     than its predecessor.
