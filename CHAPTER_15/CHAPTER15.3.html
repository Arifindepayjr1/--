        <h1> The Evolution of the Bicycle </h1>
        <p>  In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine 
             that would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two 
             same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon 
             which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground 
             , thus rolling yourself and device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
        </p>
        <p>  The machine became known as the Draisienne ( or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood.
             This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any 
             other place than a well maintain pathway such as in park or garden.
        </p>
        <p>  The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied directly to 
             the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede ( meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker,"
             since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of day made for an extremely 
             uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academeies, similar to 
             roller rinks, could be found in large cities.
        </p>
        <p>  In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. (Prior to this, metallurgy was not advance enough to 
             provide metal which was strong enough to make small, light parts out of.) The pedals were attached 
             directly to the front wheel with no freewheeling mechanism. Solid rubber tires and the long spokes 
             of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor. 
        </p>
        <p>  The front wheels became larger and larger as makers realized that the larger the wheel, the farther you could 
             travel with one rotation of the pedals. For that reason, you would puchase a wheel as large as your leg 
             lendth would allow. This machine was the first one to be called a bicycle("two wheel"). These bicycles enjoyed a 
             great popularity during the 1880s among young men of means. ( They cost an average worker six month's pay. ) 
        </p>
        <p>
             Because the rider sat so high above the center of gravity, if 
             the front wheel was stopped by a stone or rut in the road, or the sudden
             emergence of a dog, the entire apparatus rotated forward on its front axie 
             and the rider, with his legs trapped under the handlebars, was dropped unceremoniously
             on his head. Thus the term "taking a header" came into being.
