        <h2> The Composition of Seawater </h2>
        <p>  Almost anything can be found in seawater.
             This includes dissolved materials from Earth's 
             crust as well as materials released from organisms
             . The most important components of seawater that 
             influence life forms are salinity, Temperature, dissolved 
             gases ( mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutients, and pH
             . These elements vary in their composition as well as in their 
             influence on marine life.
